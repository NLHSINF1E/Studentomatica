        <h1>What is study finance?</h1>
            <p>If you will follow MBO, HBO or university education, it is logical that you have to pay for this, and it is very expensive. Not all students have access to so much money that they can pay for their studies in one go. Student finance was devised for this. Students can earn money to pay for their education. In addition to money, you will also receive a student OV chip card so that you can travel to school or your student residence for free.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="vlakvolledigepagina">
            <h1>How does study finance work?</h1>
            <p>Borrowing money for your studies is quite easy. You can easily enter your personal details and apply for a loan via the DUO website. The maximum amount that a student can borrow in academic year 2020-2021 is a   maximum of € 1,076.14 per month. This amount consists of three parts: the 'normal' loan, the loan for the supplementary grant and the tuition fee credit. You have to realize that from the moment you borrow the money you also have to pay interest.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="vlak3kwartpagina">
            <h1>What is a supplementary grant?</h1>
            <p>The idea behind supplementary grant is that your parents chip in to your study costs. But if the incomes of your parents are not high enough and they do not actually have the money to chip in to your costs. Then you can apply for a supplementary grant. You do not have to repay the supplement grant to the government as soon as you graduate within 10 years. The borrowed money of the supplementary grant then turns into a gift.</p>
    
            <h1>Repayment of your student debt.</h1>
            <p>Here are a few points that are important to know about your student debt:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two years after completing your study, you will start paying off your student debt.</li>
                <li>You have to repay your student debt within a maximum of 35 years after borrowing it. You can also repay the loan faster. </li>
                <li>How much you have to pay off per month depends on the amount you have borrowed and the amount you earn at the moment after you finished your study.</li>
                <li>You can stop the repayment up to five times for 1 year long.</li> 
                <li>You do not have to pay back an additional grant once you obtain your diploma within 10 years.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Student debt and mortgage application</h1>
            <p>The maximum amount you can get for your mortgage is lower. Since your student debt simply falls under “debts”, it will therefore affect the mortgage you want to take out. Student debt is less important than other loans. Your student debt will also not be registered at the BKR. When taking out a mortgage, you have to indicate that you have a student debt.</p>
    
            <h1>Traveling for students.</h1>
            <p>Students are entitled to a student OV chip card. You can choose the week ticket or the weekend ticket.</p> 
            <p>Week ticket: free traveling, Monday till Friday.</p>
            <p>Weekend ticket: free traveling, saturday till Sunday.</p>
            <p>If you travel at a different moment that isn’t in the guidelines of your OV chip card, you will travel with a discount, but you will have to pay.</p>
    
            <h1>Stop OV-chipkaart.</h1>
            <p>After completing your study, you don’t need your student OV chip card any longer. It is expected that you deactivate your OV-chipcard yourself and stop the subscription. Points that are important to know when deactivate your student OV chip card:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can now deactivate your OV-chipcard no later than the 10th day of the first month which you can’t use your OV-chipcard any longer.</li>
                <li>Are you still using the card when it isn’t longer allowed? Then you will receive a fine of € 75 after 2 weeks in the first month. After 1 month, the fine is € 150 after 2 weeks. That can add up considerably.</li>
            </ul>
